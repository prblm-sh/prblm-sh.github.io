Hey! I'm Chris!
Whatever godforsaken google search led you here, welcome! Let's create and solve some problems!

This page is very much a work in progress, but will be home for writeups for [picoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/practice) or [HackThebox](https://www.hackthebox.com/), probably some rants, and just maybe some helpful tips.

I'm comfy with just about all things Linux, breaking my own installation, and maybe yours! I like hacks, boom bap, and tiling winodw managers.
All exploits should be written in 4/4 time in the key of F.
