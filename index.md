# Scripts, Sautees, and Sound Production
I got my start on a computer as a child with Windows 95, started honing a craft in the kitchen at 8 years old, and ran live sound for 
Live Theatre Musical productions with up to 21 wireless mics as a freshmen and sophemore in highschool.


Well versed in all varieties of Linux, comfortable with python (and more so by the day with Rust), and most areas
of IT Security, and moonlighting as a Producer under the moniker 'Ex Salted' (Now with legal serial numbers!).

For a sample of technical writing, start with my writeups for various badges 
earned from [PentesterLab]({% link notes/pentesterLab.md%}) or my [Introduction to PicoCTF]({% link notes/picoCTFintro.md%})
