## Notes
Yeah fuck downloading via the web and then moving files, just run `wget` from the current challenge directory. 

Anyway, we get a python script.
Going by the comments in the file, the "dynamic part" of the key generation has not been verified to work. There's also something going on with a trial_user and also a btrial_user, I'm not sure of the significance at the moment. 
At the bottom of the script is a base64 encoded (sort of lmao) copy of the supposed entire "full keygen."

Username is "GOUGH" which gets fed into the b64 decode, I'm guessing the additional bUsername_trial = b"GOUGH" is to make it 8 characters to cooperate with b64???


Option b of the menu for the script points to a SQL database, which can be found near the beginning of the script.

Route A: reverse the full version unlock key, "unlock" the full version from there, find flag in full version.

Route 1: reverse/crack the "full-version" base64 at the end, find flag in full version

Route U38: break/abuse the SQL database and find the flag within there? quite possibly a red herring though.
