### PicoGym
This is where all the challenges for the PicoCTF can be found. It also functions as your 'home screen' with access to user account info, solves challenges, resources, etc.
The Gym has a (limited?) WebShell available for every user, however the builtin webshell *is not* required to solve any challenges. The webshell is mainly intended for users who do not have access to a local shell env, such as those using school/leased/borrowed hardware. Assume all sessions are actively logged and monitored.
All challenges can be solved from a *local machine* either by downloading (and manipulating) the proper files, or connecting to a remote port/service in the PicoGym.
Challenges appear to be sorted by ascending point level, so I assume they also scale in difficulty.
To solve the challenge, submit the flag in the submission box of the same challenge.
