### Padding - Cryptography
Padding is the practice of adding additional data to the begginning, middle, or end of a message *prior* to said message being encrypted. The exact method varies by the nature of the encryption being used. This ranges from adding random words or phrases to a plain-text message, to adding random single bytes to a file.
