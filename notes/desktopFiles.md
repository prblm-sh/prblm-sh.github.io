## Linux Desktop Files

A `.desktop` file is a shortcut that allows an installed application to be started from the program launcher instead of running it directly from the CLI.

Most programs installed through the package manager will create a `.dekstop` file in either `/usr/share/applications` or `~/.local/share/applications`.
