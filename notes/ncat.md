### Ncat (*not Netcat*)
Ncat is a redevelopment of the original `netcat` project.
Ncat was developed as part of the nmap project to combine more modern and more advanced features of the original tools. However, while similar, `ncat` and `netcat` *are not* 100% compatible and care should be taken to be sure exactly which tool is being used on a system.
