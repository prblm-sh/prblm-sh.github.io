# Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

#### Purpose
The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a directory service protocol that runs on a layer above the TCP/IP stack. It provides a mechanism used to connect to, search, and modify Internet directories.

The LDAP directory service is based on a client-server model. The function of LDAP is to enable access to an existing directory.

The data model (data and namespace) of LDAP is similar to that of the X.500 OSI directory service, but with lower resource requirements. The associated LDAP API simplifies writing Internet directory service applications.

#### Where applicable
The LDAP API is applicable to directory management and browser applications that do not have directory service support as their primary function. Conversely, LDAP is neither applicable to creating directories, nor specifying how a directory service operates.
